# LangChain-_PDF_Q-A_with_HuggingFace
 This project is a simple question-answering application built with **LangChain** that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It leverages open-source Hugging Face models and runs entirely on CPU â€” **no API keys or paid services required**.
